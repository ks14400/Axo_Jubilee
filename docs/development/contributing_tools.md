# Tool Contribution Guidelines

## Overview

Most development starts with a GitHub Issue. See more about issues on the [Development page](https://machineagency.github.io/science-jubilee/development/index.html).

If you're adding a new tool, you should follow the same steps outlined in the Code Contribution Guidelines. However, adding tools also requires design files and assembly instructions. This page provides guidelines for this process.

### Design Files

In your pull request, please include the design file in addition to fabrication exports. For example, if you design a new tool in SolidWorks, include both the SolidWorks file and an exported `stl`. These files should be added to the [Tool Library](https://github.com/machineagency/science-jubilee/tree/main/tool_library) in subdirectories named `cads` and `stls` (or something similar). Take a look at the existing tools for reference.

### Assembly Instructions

In Progress.
