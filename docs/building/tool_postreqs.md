## Tool Parking Positions

After you build a tool, you'll need to set the exact location of the tool so it can be picked up. This process is detailed in the [parking posts documentation](parking_posts.md). There is also a [write-up on the Jubilee wiki](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Setting_Tool_Parking_Positions).


## Tool Offsets

Tools come in many shapes and sizes. To accommodate tools of different heights and prevent crashes with the bed plate, we need to set a Z offset. To make sure that the tip of each tool is aligned to one another, we also need to set an X-Y offset. Follow the [tool offsets guide](tool_offsets.md) to set your tool offsets. There is also a [guide for this using a slightly different method](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Setting_Tool_Offsets) on the main Jubilee wiki

## Duet Configuration

Each tool will need to be configured in softwareâ€”see individual tool documentation for more information.
